# Spam-Classifier

Spam Classifier

This uses the data from UCI Machine Learning Repository

It primarly performs some NLP on the spam/ not spam data and converts it into Bag of Words model (vectorized)

It is then used to train the Multinomial Naive Bayes ML model which generally works well on NLP data

We achieve a final accuracy of 86% and helped client classify the email as spam/ not spam
