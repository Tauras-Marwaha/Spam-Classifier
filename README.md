# NLP and Text Analysis

# Fake News Classifier
This uses the fake news data from Kaggle

It primarly performs some NLP on the news text and converts it into Bag of Words model (vectorized), TF-IDF Model, Hashing Vectorizer Model

It is then used to train the Multinomial Naive Bayes ML, Passive Aggressive, Multinomial classifier model

We achieve a final accuracy of ~88% and helped to distinguish fake news from real ones


# Spam Classifier
This uses the data from UCI Machine Learning Repository

It primarly performs some NLP on the spam/ not spam data and converts it into Bag of Words model (vectorized)

It is then used to train the Multinomial Naive Bayes ML model which generally works well on NLP data

We achieve a final accuracy of 86% and helped client classify the email as spam/ not spam

# Stock Price Fluctuation Predictor
This uses the stock price data from Kaggle

It primarly performs some NLP on the text and converts it into Bag of Words model (vectorized)

It is then used to train the Random Forest classifier model which generally works well on NLP data

We achieve a final accuracy of 86% and helped client predict any deltas in the stock price
